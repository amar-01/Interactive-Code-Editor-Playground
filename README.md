## ‚ú® Project Overview

The **Interactive Code Editor Playground** is a minimalist, browser-based code editor that allows developers to write and instantly preview HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real-time. Inspired by platforms like CodePen and JSFiddle, this project aims to provide a sandbox environment for rapid prototyping, learning, and testing front-end snippets without needing a full development environment.

This project was built entirely from scratch, demonstrating a deep understanding of core web technologies and advanced DOM manipulation techniques, without relying on heavy frameworks.

## üí° Key Features

* **HTML, CSS, & JavaScript Editors:** Dedicated input panes for each language.
* **Real-time Live Preview:** Instantly see the rendered output of your code.
* **Resizable Panes:** Drag-and-drop functionality to adjust the size of code editors and the preview area for optimal workflow.
* **Console Output Capture (Advanced):** Displays `console.log()` outputs and JavaScript errors from the sandbox environment directly within the playground.
* **Debounced Updates:** Efficiently updates the preview only after a brief pause in typing, optimizing performance.
* **Isolated Execution (using `<iframe>`):** Code runs in a sandboxed environment, preventing conflicts with the main application.
* **Lightweight & Performant:** Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for a fast and responsive experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For structuring the content.
* **CSS3:** For styling and responsive layout (Flexbox/Grid).
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For all interactive functionalities, DOM manipulation, and logic.
* *Optional (if integrated):* **CodeMirror / Monaco Editor:** For professional-grade syntax highlighting and editor features. (Mention if you integrate one; otherwise, remove this line).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser to open the `index.html` file. No server or complex setup is required.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/interactive-code-editor-playground.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd interactive-code-editor-playground
    ```
3.  **Open the `index.html` file:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

### Usage

* Type your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code into the respective editor panes.
* The live preview will update automatically as you type.
* Drag the dividers between panes to resize them.
* Check the console output area (if implemented) for any JavaScript logs or errors.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

* **Syntax Highlighting:** Integrate a robust library like CodeMirror or Monaco Editor for a better coding experience.
* **Local Storage Persistence:** Save user's code locally so it's not lost on refresh.
* **Pre-processor Support:** Add options for SCSS/Sass, Less, or Babel.
* **External Library Imports:** Allow users to include external CSS/JS libraries (e.g., Bootstrap, jQuery).
* **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Implement shortcuts for common actions (e.g., run code, save).
* **Full Screen Mode:** Toggle individual editor panes or the output to full screen.
* **File Upload/Download:** Ability to upload existing files or download the current code.
* **Theming:** Dark mode/light mode toggles.
